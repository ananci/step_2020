      <h1>Ananci's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>I am a software Engineer at Google who is supporting a pod of STEP interns 
          through the 2020 summer STEP program. I typically deal with ML, AI and 
          backend systems so I'm using this portfolio as a way to refresh my front 
          end knowledge. It is probably going to look terrible.</p>
      <p>I will probably just put lots of pictures of close up cat faces here.

      <p>Click here to get a random name of one of my cats:</p>
